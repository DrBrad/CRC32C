UnCrypt
========
This is an OpenSource Encryption library for all the major programming and scripting languages.

About UnCrypt
-----
We plan to implement all of the hashing functions along with most of the encryption methods commonly used. We want to keep everything very transparent and secure.

Language Implementations
-----
I plan to implement this hashing algorithm in all major languages. Including:
```
Java
C
C++
Python
JavaScript
Go
Swift
PHP
```
